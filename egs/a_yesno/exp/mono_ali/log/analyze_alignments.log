At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 96.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (85,84.7,102) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (96,96.0,96) frames.
At utterance begin, N_S accounts for 3.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (96,96.0,96) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (101,106.0,153) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 51.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,38.4,105) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 48.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,35.2,42) frames.
Overall, N_S accounts for 26.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,33.9,45) frames.
Overall, Y_S accounts for 21.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (37,36.8,41) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 54.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 68.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 33.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 45.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,21.5,32)
